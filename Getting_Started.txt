1. Wire Arduino and Breadboard properly (Check Wiring)
2. Make sure you have a sufficient power supply and the volts being outputted corresponds with how many volts your LEDs require to power.
3. Connect the Arduino to your computer with your A to B USB cable (your computer should install its driver automatically).
4. Download the Arduino Software Environment from here (https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) and extract it to a folder
5. Download the Processing Software Environment from here (https://processing.org/download/) and extract it to a folder near your Arduino SE folder.
6. Download the Arduino library for Processing from here, and copy (http://playground.arduino.cc/Interfacing/Processing) it into your Processing/libraries folder.
7. Run the arduino.exe program in your Arduino SE folder.
8. Go to File -> Examples -> Firmata -> StandardFirmata, and press the Upload button on the Arduino SE
9. Wait a few seconds, until your RX/TX LEDs on your Arduino stop blinking (which means the Firmata firmware is installed).
10. Open Processing (processing.exe), then open the ProjectCode.pde file in the ProjectCode folder.
11. Edit the line of code "File f = new File(U:\\186Project\\Project\\data");". Instead of using ""U:\\186Project\\Project\\data"", use the name of your directory with the MP3 files in it.
12. Hit the Run button on the top-left.
