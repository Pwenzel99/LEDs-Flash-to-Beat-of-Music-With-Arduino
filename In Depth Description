This is a project that I made in my CPRE 186 class with three other classmates. In this project, we used an Arduino for our hardware and
for software we used a combination of Processing(in Java) and ArduinoIno(C/C++). In Processing, we made use of the Minim library, which
is a library used for real-time audio analysis, and the Arduino Library, which allows us to send signals to the Arduino. For the Arduino, 
we uploaded the axample file StandardFirmata. StandardFirmata is software that allows the Arduino itself to communicate with software that 
is running on a host computer. For the Bluetooth version, we also used Processing and ArduinoINO. In Processing, we used almost the same 
code but we had to import BluetoothSerial and use serialwrite instead of analogwrite. In the ArduinoINO code, we wrote our own code using 
the Serial library and it took the signals coming in from the Processing code and turned it into usable data.
